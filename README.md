# DataRepairAndFairness

I had the invaluable opportunity to engage in research under the guidance of Professor Sudeepa Roy and Dr. Amir Gilad, with whom I am currently investigating algorithmic bias in representation for marginalized subpopulations, particularly within various data repair algorithms and machine learning-based synthetic data generators. As I delved deeper into exploring advanced data repair techniques that optimally clean and enrich relations while incurring minimal change, I recognized the immense potential to not only rectify the limitations of synthetic data but also to preserve representation for marginalized demographics. This dual objective holds the promise of enhancing both the accuracy and equity of predictive ML models. Throughout this process, I assessed how these processes often led to a lack of representation for undercounted and often overlooked communities, particularly in terms of race and gender. My work finding optimal and equitable algorithms for database repair is crucial due to the widespread use of data repair algorithms for synthetic data generation, where artificially generated data is used to parallel real-world datasets, protect sensitive data, and overcome data scarcity.
